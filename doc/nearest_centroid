     This box aims to create a machine learning model based on NearestCentroid
     algorithm implemented in scikit-learn. 
     The user can modify nearly all the settings from scikit-learn. 
     It is possible for the user to test his model with a test set. 
     He can also save the model in a file which he can use with 
     the ProcessML box.
    
    Logistic Regression (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier.

    In the multiclass case, the training algorithm uses the one-vs-rest
    (OvR) scheme if the ‘multi_class’ option is set to ‘ovr’, and uses the
    cross-entropy loss if the ‘multi_class’ option is set to ‘multinomial’.
    (Currently the ‘multinomial’ option is supported only by the ‘lbfgs’,
    ‘sag’, ‘saga’ and ‘newton-cg’ solvers.)

    This class implements regularized logistic regression using the
    ‘liblinear’ library, ‘newton-cg’, ‘sag’, ‘saga’ and ‘lbfgs’ solvers.
    Note that regularization is applied by default. It can handle both
    dense and sparse input. Use C-ordered arrays or CSR matrices containing
    64-bit floats for optimal performance; any other input format will be
    converted (and copied).

     * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithmNearestCentroid_Setting1|
     The box clock frequency. The Python process function is called at 
     each tick.

     * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithmNearestCentroid_Setting2|
     The path to the file where the user want to save the model.
     If empty, the model is not saved.
     * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithmNearestCentroid_Setting2|
    
     * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithmNearestCentroid_Setting3|
     The path to the file where the user want to load a model.
     If empty, a new model will be created.
     * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithmNearestCentroid_Setting3|
    
      * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithmNearestCentroid_Setting4|
     The name of the scikit-learn algorithm. The user should not try
     to modify this setting.
     * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithmNearestCentroid_Setting4|
    
      * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithmNearestCentroid_Setting5|
     Float between 0 and 1 (1 not included) which represents the proportion 
     of the input dataset transformed into a test set, allowing us to 
     evaluate our model once the training on the set train is done. If 0 
     is filled in, then all the data will constitute the train set and no 
     metrics will be displayed.
     * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithmNearestCentroid_Setting5|
    
      * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithmNearestCentroid_Setting6|
     Names of the labels of input's data. This parameter is only usefull 
     when the PolyMode is used (several streamed matrix in input, one for
     each label). Then the labels as to be described as follows :
     "my_label_1, mylabel_2, my_label_3, etc"
     Otherwise the labels will be "1, 2, 3, etc". 
     If the input mode is ov-mode (one input streamed matrix and one 
     stimulation), the labels will be read by the stimulations.

    The rest of the settings are from scikit-learn. You can find 
    their purpose here :
